Holston Public Bookstore 
Test Plan Document 
 
Introduction 
This testing plan outlines the approach, criteria, and 
responsibilities for testing the Holston Public Bookstore 
developed by my CSci 387 Software Design and Development class.   
The purpose of this plan is to ensure the quality and 
reliability of the software application before its deployment. 
 
Test Items 
The test items include all modules, functionalities, and 
components of the Holston Public Bookstore that require 
validation through testing. 
 
A. Features Not To Be Tested: 
i. Login with Google Authentication System 
B. Features To Be Tested: 
i. Account Creation 
Approach: Unit Testing 
Item Pass Criteria: After required information is 
supplied to the form, the new user can log into the 
system. 
ii. Adding a Book 
Approach: Unit Testing 
Item Pass Criteria: After required information is 
supplied and form for a book that wasn’t previously 
in the system, that book is now visible in the 
system to the library’s staff. 
iii.  Deleting a Book 
Approach: Unit Testing 
Item Fail Criteria: After deletion, book is still 
visible in the system to the customers. 
iv. Updating a Book 
Approach: Unit Testing 
Item Pass Criteria: Information about the book is 
updated with new information. 
 
Suspension Criteria And Resumption Requirements 
Testing may be suspended if critical defects impact testing 
progress or if there are environmental issues affecting test 
execution. Testing will resume once the issues are resolved, and 
the environment is stable. 
 
Test Deliverables 
Test plans and test cases. 
Test execution reports. 
Defect reports and resolutions. 
Test summary report. 
 
Environmental Needs 
Testing environments mirroring production environments. 
Access to testing tools and resources. 
Stable internet connectivity. 
Computer with web browser 
Selenium Automation Testing Environment with web driver. 
 
Responsibilities 
Development Team: Provide builds for testing and address defects 
raised during testing. 
Testing Team: Design, execute, and report test cases. Identify 
and report defects. 
Project Manager: Oversee testing activities and ensure alignment 
with project timelines. 
 
Staffing And Training Needs 
Testing team members should possess expertise in manual and 
automated testing methodologies. 
Training may be provided for new tools or technologies 
introduced during the testing process. 
 
Schedule 
Testing activities will be conducted in parallel with the 
development phase, following an iterative approach. Specific 
testing milestones and timelines will be aligned with the 
project schedule. 
 
Risks And Contingencies 
Risks include resource constraints, dependencies on third-party 
components, and scope changes. 
Contingencies may involve reallocating resources, adjusting 
timelines, or prioritizing critical functionalities. 
 
Approvals: 
This testing plan requires approval from the project 
stakeholders and the Product Manager before testing activities 
commence. Any modifications to the plan will be documented and 
communicated accordingly.

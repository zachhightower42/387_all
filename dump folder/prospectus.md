	OM Events is an event management system that helps run events smoothly on campus. It allows users to request a particular event space or submit an event that a manager can assign a space to. It also helps keep event workers informed about which events have been assigned to them. What follows are a few different proposals for the system, organized from least to most difficult.
The minimum viable product is served through a web page and supports three distinct user types, managers, event organizers, and event workers. Managers have the highest permissions in the system. They can cancel events, assign spaces, make spaces unavailable, change event or event space descriptions, and process booking requests sent by event organizers. Event organizers and managers will view a drop down list displaying the currently available spaces. Event organizers may request space for an event at a specific time. Event workers will be able to sign up to work through the web portal. They will be able to view events they have been booked for and the positions assigned to them. 
The next level of features expands on the MVP. It includes a fourth user type, attendee. Attendees will be prospective event-goers, able to search for upcoming events and sign up to receive notifications from events that interest them. Workers will be able to search upcoming events and choose ones they wish to work at, should they wish to do so. Upcoming events will now have a follower count associated with them, showing how many have signed up to receive notifications about it. Managers and Event organizers will be able to see available spaces by searching a list and when one is selected, the system will display a page of general information. General information here is capacity, booking history, seating type, and type of venue. Event organizers will also be able to choose venue types when requesting a space. This will help managers in determining which event space to assign, when the organizer does not have a specific one in mind. Notifications will be served to the users both in the web portal and through email, should they sign up for it. 
	The furthest stretch goals of the OM events service expands into a simple mobile app. The most consequential additional feature made possible by the mobile version will be allowing users to receive push notifications. Push notifications would allow for all previous notifications to be served in an easier to process form. They would also allow for more real time communications. E.g “Event starts in 15 minutes.” The search function for events in this version will also allow managers and event organizers the ability to tag events. This will be largely to the benefit of attendees, allowing them to find events that suit them easier. The search function for venue spaces and events will also be expanded to include photos, in addition to text.

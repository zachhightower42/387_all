- Ensure that we can authenticate users and hide features on dashboard/prevent access to dropdown menu items in the navigation bar based on that
- Check event creation, add the ability for event organizers/admins to staff it with available workers
- Change like to approve for any users recognized as admins (don't do this, this is just going to be on a separate admin page)
- Check through the ERD and design an event space search for organizers and admins
- Give the admins the option to add an event space
- Make the page for workers to sign up, allow them to edit their profile if desired, make sure it updates based on hours assigned
- Add notifications to the dashboard

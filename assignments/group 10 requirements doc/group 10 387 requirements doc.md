# Goals

- **Event Creation**: Allow event organizers to create events.
- **Event Management**: Allow admins to approve events, cancel events, and manage event spaces. Allow organizers to edit their events and cancel them. 
- **Worker Assignments**: Let event workers view their assigned events and post the hours they can work. 
- **Role-Based Access**: Role based permissions for admins, organizers, workers, and attendees. 
- **Notification System**: Notify users (via web portal) about event approvals, cancellations, or updates.
- **Searchable Events**: Allow attendees to search through approved events and like them to receive updates. 
  
## Minimum Viable Product

The MVP is a web-based event management system with four user roles: admins, organizers, workers, and attendees. Admins have top level permissions to access and edit the system. Admin approval is required for events. Organizers can create events, edit them, and receive notifications about  approval. Event workers can view their assigned events and post their workable hours. A notification system informs users of event updates via the portal and email. A drop-down menu displays available spaces for event organizers and admins.

# Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system must efficiently handle multiple concurrent users, events, and event spaces.
- **Security**: Ensure secure user authentication and role-based access to sensitive features.
- **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive interface for all roles, with simple navigation.
- **Performance**: The system must have quick load times and realtime event and space updates.
- **Data Backup**: The system should have regular data backups to ensure that records are not lost.

---

# Risks

- **Double-Booking**: Potential for spaces to be double-booked by different event organizers. Mitigated by availability updates and approval requirements.
- **Info Security**: Will be handling sensitive user info at many stages. (E.g. Worker names and contact info.)  
- **Missable Updates**: Important updates could be missed if users do not check event portal. (E.g. Showing up for a cancelled event)

---

# Future Iterations
- **Mobile App**:
  - A mobile app with push notifications for event updates and reminders.
- **Enhanced Search Features**:
  - Event organizers can filter event spaces by venue type, booking history, and venue photos to find the best match.
- **Most Liked Events**:
  - Display a selection of the most liked events on the dashboard
- **Staffing automation**
  - Allow workers to give a list of preferred to least preferred event types and let the system automatically place them into approved events.

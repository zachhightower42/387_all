- 5 minutes assigned for questions 
	- some from Holston
	- some from other groups on the demonstration and presentation


- It has to be hosted on Turing and given as a live demo

- Include a link in the presentation so that we can swap easily to the demo
- Name the presentation files as `group` and then `group #`

- We can make a Use case diagram for our users (good idea for presentation)

- Use case diagram should cover all functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements should be in another section separate from the other shit

- We should talk about the decision making process, the technologies we could have used.
	- "Why did you do X"
	- "Why did you decide to use/not use X technology or framework?"

- Talk about what specific individuals did within the powerpoint
	- X did Y amount of this

- Have busywork done already before showing the rest of the features of the system
	- Have different accounts already made
	- Try to note waste time on typing too much stuff
	- Spend as much time as possible away from static pages, try to show all the dynamic pages and how they change and actually perform things for the application

- Make sure there are no bugs in the presentation.

- Take the powerpoint, talk about what you want it to say, and then break up the slides among the group members, then put it together, then talk about it and modify what needs to be modified
- Practice the presentation beforehand, probably on Monday when we get back if at all possible?
